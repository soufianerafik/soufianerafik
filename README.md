### Hi there! 

I'm Soufiane (pronounced: Souf-Yen), and I work as a full-time software engineer. My journey has led me to collaborate with diverse clients and government agencies, where I've developed software solutions that are user-friendly, secure, and reliable.

My main focus has been on backend development, utilizing technologies like  NestJS/Node.js, Postgres, MongoDB, and Redis. Additionally, I have significant experience in frontend development, specifically with Angular. With this diverse skill set, I possess a solid foundation in object-oriented programming, relational databases, and API development.

Before my professional career, I gained valuable experience in various industries, from restaurants and coffee shops to retail and tech. These experiences taught me effective communication and business skills while emphasizing the importance of software in business success.

Outside of coding, I enjoy pursuing photography, collecting records, and creating music. These creative hobbies inspire me and help me explore my technical skills in a fun and exciting way.

Feel free to reach out to me for any software projects or collaborations. Let's build something great together! ‚úåüèº
