# 👋 Hi, I’m Soufiane (pronounced: *Souf-Yen*)  

I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** passionate about building secure, user-friendly, accessible and reliable software. Over the years, I’ve collaborated with clients ranging from **government agencies** and **universities** to **startups**, developing solutions that meet diverse needs and solve real-world problems.  

## 💻 What I Do  
I have extensive experience in full-stack development, leveraging tools and technologies like:
- **Frontend:** Angular / NgRx, HTML, CSS/SCSS, TypeScript/JavaScript, jQuery, Material, Bootstrap, Web Accessibility
- **Backend:** NestJS / Node.js, Python / Django, FastAPI, Flask  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, SQL Server, MySQL
- **DevOps & Infrastructure:** Kubernetes, Helm, Flux, Docker, Linux, GitHub Actions

With a solid background in **object-oriented & functional programming**, **API development**, and **relational databases**, I thrive in building scalable, accessible and maintainable systems that just work.  

## 🌱 My Journey  
Before diving into tech full-time, I worked in **restaurants, coffee shops, retail, and tech**, where I discovered how software can drive business success. These experiences also helped me develop strong **communication** and **business skills**—traits I carry with me into every project I build today.  

## 🎵 Beyond Code  
When I’m not coding, I enjoy:  
- 📸 Photography  
- 🎶 Collecting records & making music  

These hobbies spark my creativity and fuel new perspectives on my technical work.

If you have a project idea or are looking to collaborate, **feel free to reach out!** Let's build something amazing together. ✌🏼
