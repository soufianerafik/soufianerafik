# 👋 Hi, I’m Soufiane (pronounced: *Souf-Yen*)  
I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** with a passion for building secure, user-friendly, and reliable software that solves real-world problems.  
Over the years, I’ve collaborated with **government agencies**, **universities**, and **startups**, delivering solutions that scale and make a meaningful impact.


## 💻 What I Do
I'm a generalist full-stack developer with hands-on experience across:

- **Frontend:** Angular, NgRx, TypeScript, HTML, SCSS, Material, Bootstrap, Accessibility  
- **Backend:** NestJS, Node.js, Django, FastAPI, Flask  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, MySQL, SQL Server  
- **DevOps & Infrastructure:** Kubernetes, Helm, Flux, Docker, Linux, GitHub Actions  

I bring a strong **product mindset** and **entrepreneurial spirit** to every project. I focus on building full experiences that solve real problems, scale well, and make sense to the user.

I care about writing clean, maintainable code and designing systems teams can trust and build on.

## 🌱 My Journey  
Before entering tech full-time, I worked in restaurants, retail, coffee shops, and support roles — experiences that shaped how I think about **people**, **products**, and how software can drive business success. They also gave me strong **communication and business skills** — traits I carry with me into every project I build today.  

## 🎵 Beyond Code  
When I’m not building software, I’m usually:
- 🎶 Making music or digging through vinyl crates
- 📸 Shooting/Editing photos

These creative outlets help me stay curious and recharge. 

## 🤝 Let’s Connect

Have a project in mind? Want to chat about systems design, product ideas, tooling or music?  
I love connecting with other engineers, founders, and builders.  
**Feel free to reach out — I’m always open to good conversations.**
