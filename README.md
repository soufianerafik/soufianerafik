# 👋 Hi, I’m Soufiane (pronounced: *Souf-Yen*)  
I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** with a passion for building secure, user-friendly, and reliable software that solves real-world problems.  
Over the years, I’ve collaborated with **government agencies**, **universities**, and **startups**, delivering solutions that scale and make a meaningful impact.


## 💻 What I Do  
I have extensive experience in full-stack development, leveraging tools and technologies like:
- **Frontend:** Angular / NgRx, HTML, CSS/SCSS, TypeScript/JavaScript, jQuery, Material, Bootstrap, Web Accessibility
- **Backend:** NestJS / Node.js, Python / Django, FastAPI, Flask  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, SQL Server, MySQL
- **DevOps & Infrastructure:** Kubernetes, Helm, Flux, Docker, Linux, GitHub Actions

I enjoy designing clean, scalable systems and writing maintainable code that teams can trust and build on. 

## 🌱 My Journey  
Before entering tech full-time, I worked in restaurants, retail, coffee shops, and support roles — experiences that shaped how I think about **people**, **products**, and how software can drive business success. They also gave me strong **communication and business skills** — traits I carry with me into every project I build today.  

## 🎵 Beyond Code  
When I’m not building software, I’m usually:
- 🎶 Making music or digging through vinyl crates
- 📸 Shooting/Editing photos

These creative outlets help me stay curious and recharge.
